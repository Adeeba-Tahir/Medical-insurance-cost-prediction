# Medical-insurance-cost-prediction
This project is dedicated to developing a machine learning model capable of predicting an individual's medical insurance costs. The core objective is to accurately estimate the charges (the medical insurance cost) by analyzing a set of input features. These features represent key personal and demographic attributes of the individuals in the dataset, including their age, sex, bmi (Body Mass Index), the number of children they have, their smoker status, and their geographical region. By leveraging these diverse factors, the model aims to uncover the complex relationships that influence medical insurance expenses, ultimately providing a predictive tool for cost estimation
